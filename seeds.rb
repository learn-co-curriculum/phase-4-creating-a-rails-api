    director: "Julie Taymor",
    description: "Her portrait, with that thick unibrow and un-waxed upper lip, has become an iconic symbol of feminism. Julie Taymor's biopic takes us behind the canvas to reveal the artist, the activist, the revolutionary. And knowing what we do now about lead actress Selma Hayek's off-screen experience, this film proves an even greater victory.",

    description: "Disney has a way of making us feel like pawns in a game of Let's See How Hard We Can Make Them Cry. But that's not the case with Mira Nair's feel-good drama about a Uganda girl's path to chess champ, adapted from an ESPN sports essay. Moms and dads, you want your daughters to grow up to be chess champions.",

    description: "There's a lot at play here: Persepolis is animated like a graphic novel. It's done in black and white. It's about a girl who defies Islamic fundamentalists. It's autobiographical. And it's in French. The result: a brilliant feminist feat from Marjane Satrapi.",

Sure, it's directed by Ridley Scott, but the screenplay about a pair of outlaws who are anything but passive comes straight from the pen of Callie Khouri.",

    description: "Unearthing feminism in a scorched, hell-on-wheels action flick from road warrior franchise man George Miller isn't exactly obvious. But though it's titled after a male character, he is muzzled for much of the film, lending the action to a female imperator and her feminist revolt against the horrors of sexism.",

But it's so much more than that—it's Ergüven's personal comment on what it means to be a woman in Turkey.",
